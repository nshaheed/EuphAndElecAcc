Scattered Circulations requires the following equipment:
	   A microphone,
	   A pedal (either audio or MIDI based),
	   And 1-2 speakers (The program outputs to stereo, but both channels are the same)

Audio: To start/stop the audio, click on the button labled Start/Stop Audio.
	   To adjust the volume, use the slider in the Master Audio section.

Reverb Volume: The Low value indicates the dB levels of the reverb in sections I, II
       & IV, the High in section III.  Adjust this to ensure that the reverb is properly
       balanced with the the rest of the electronics and isn't clipping or distoring.

Section Selection: Use these buttons to move between sections (as indicated on the score)

Recording: To record, first hit the open button, and create a file to record to.
	   To begin recording, hit the button below the open button.

To adjust audio and midi settings: Double click on the midi/dac~ buttons in the
	   Settings section. 

Pedal Settings: Use this section to change the type of pedal used.  To test if the pedal
 	   is working, hit the pedal test button and press the pedal, if the pedal tests
	   results button lights up, it works.
       The Test Audio button plays a low frequency to ensure that the speakers are working
	   properly.

Decrescendo Time: The decrescendo that encasulates section IV is divided into two parts:
	   The initial, slower dec. 1 that takes the accompaniment's volume to a low
	   level, and the faster dec. 2 that lowers the volume to nothing. 

Pitch Detector:  The graph in this section displays the detected pitch for section II.
	   When the line reaches the top of the graph, it will trigger the move to section III.

The Keyboard:  The keyboard is used to display what pitch the euphonium sample being
       triggered by the pedal in sections II & IV is.

When using an audio pedal:  The microphone must be the first audio input channel, and
	   the pedal be the second.
